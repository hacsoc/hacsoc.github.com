            CWRU Hacker Society is a common ground for those who are interested
            in digging into the innards of things; for those who are not
            satisfied by easy answers; and for those who seek to make the world
            a better place using computers. Our mission is to promote an open
            society through understanding and improving the technology which
            underpins it.

            Hacker Society consists of a weekly "lecture series" where members
            and outside hackers present on a topic of interest. We have a
            history of having in-depth talks on a wide variety of subjects.

                On the nature of Hacking</a> by

            In addition, we host the school <strong>hackathon</strong>
            (hackCWRU), <strong>tech conference</strong> (link-state), send
            club members to hackathons and conferences such as the Grace Hopper
            Celebration (all expenses paid). We also hang out outside of class
            to help each other with <strong>side projects and
                classwork</strong>. Yes, this means we also host the boring
            albeit useful things like <strong>class advising help</strong> and
            <strong>coding-interview prep workshops</strong>.
        </p>
        <p>
            We pride ourselves on <strong>welcoming new members from all
                disciplines</strong> (you don't even need to know how to code,
            we promise).
